    abstract = { It is shown that \$O(N^{5/2} )\$ comparisons and additions suffice to solve the all-pairs shortest path problem for directed graphs on N vertices with nonnegative edge weights. In conjunction with preprocessing, this result is exploited to produce an \$o(N^3 )\$ algorithm for solving the shortest path problem. }
